# Solved exercises for "Algorithms" by R. Sedgewick

This is a collection of solved exercises for the book "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick.
Most of them come in the form of executable Java code, and some as Markdown docs.

I wrote and tested the exercises using the following Java version:

> $ java -version  
> openjdk version "16.0.2" 2021-07-20  
> OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 16.0.2+7-67)  
> OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0.2+7-67, mixed mode, sharing)  

In order to aid me in working with the book, I created a series of scripts.

You can run a single exercise by running `./script/run-ex <chapter> <section> <exercise> [arg1] [arg2] [...]`. For instance:

![Running an exercise](./README/run_exercise_output.png)

**Disclaimer:** I learnt Java as I advanced through the exercises. I'm not a seasoned Java developer, and that reflects in my code style and the way I setup this project.
